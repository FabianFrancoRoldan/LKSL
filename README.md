LaKraven Studios Standard Library [LKSL]
====

Installation
====
Don't forget to run **INSTALL.BAT** to register the necessary Environment Variables.

Current Features
====
  - **Stream Handling Library**: makes working with Streams much easier.
  - **Streamables Engine**: an engine for serializing and loading custom objects to/from Streams.
  - **High Precision Threading**: a special Thread type which provide extremely accurate "reference times" for interpolation and extrapolation (perfect for powering Simulation and Rendering processes).
  - **Event Engine**: a *very* powerful, highly optimized engine for producing Multi-Threaded, Asynchronous, Event-Driven systems.
  - **SI Units Math**: A library to convert between different SI Units, their orders of magnitude, and a growing number of other mathematical functions.

> If there's another platform that you think could benefit from the features of the LKSL, please raise an issue. Better yet, if you feel you can produce a viable LKSL translation (in part or whole) for another programming/scripting language, please consider contributing that work back to this original repository!

This Library is still in EARLY DEVELOPMENT!
====
Please keep in mind that this library is still in its infancy, and while many of its features work very well, the interfaces are by no means "final" at this point.
In fact, there are plans to change many of them (particularly in the Event Engine units). This redesign effort is referred to internally as the "redux". You will see it mentioned quite often in recent commits.

> NOTE: C++ Builder versions will be added at a slower rate (unless you want to help producing verbatim C++ translations of the Delphi units, which would be very-much welcomed)

Documentation
====
Feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/LaKraven/LKSL/wiki">LKSL Wiki</a> to learn how the LKSL can be integrated into your systems (or, as the case may be, how your system can be designed to best utilize the features of the LKSL).

You can also find educational articles demonstrating the various features of the LKSL can be found at http://otapi.com.
