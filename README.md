LaKraven Studios Standard Library [LKSL]
====

This library provides a vast (and growing) range of powerful features for the following programming languages:
  - Delphi
  - C++ Builder
  - FreePascal/Lazarus

This Library is still in EARLY DEVELOPMENT!
====
Please keep in mind that this library is still in its infancy, and while many of its features work very well, the interfaces are by no means "final" at this point.
In fact, there are plans to change many of them (particularly in the Event Engine units). Also, unit names will soon be changing (but that's a one-time thing, easy to resolve in your implementations).

> NOTE: C++ Builder versions will be added at a slower rate (unless you want to help producing verbatim C++ translations of the Delphi units, which would be very-much welcomed)

Current Features
====
  - Stream Handling Library (makes working with Streams much easier)
  - Streamables Engine (an engine for serializing and loading custom objects to/from Streams)
  - High Precision Threading (a special Thread type which provide extremely accurate "reference times" for interpolation)
  - Event Engine (a VERY powerful, highly optimized engine for producing Multi-Threaded, Asynchronous, Event-Driven systems)

Feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/LaKraven/LKSL/wiki">LKSL Wiki</a> to learn how the LKSL can be integrated into your systems (or, as the case may be, how your system can be designed to best utilize the features of the LKSL).

You can also find educational articles demonstrating the various features of the LKSL can be found at http://otapi.com.
