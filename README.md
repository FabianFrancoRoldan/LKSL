LaKraven Studios Standard Library [LKSL]
====

LaKraven Studios Standard Library (for RAD Studio and AppMethod)

This library provides a vast (and growing) range of powerful features for Delphi and C++ Builder.

NOTE: C++ Builder versions will be added at a slower rate (unless you want to help producing verbatim C++ translations of the Delphi units, which would be very-much welcomed)
